## Introduction

In computing, **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types [[1](#reference-1)]. A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server. When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string. Parse the data with JSON Parser, and the data becomes a JavaScript object.

Recently, the amount of data transmitted by the network has soared. To process all the data before users feel a noticeable delay, the speed required for JSON Parser has been greatly increased and traditional parsers are too slow to meet demand.

In this context, **Didi Chuxing Technology Department** created **Jsoniter** to make JSON parsing faster and easier. Jsoniter Java version could be **3** times faster than jackson/gson/fastjson and Jsoniter Golang version could be more than **6** times faster than standard lib (encoding/json) [[2](#reference-2)]. Besides, Jsoniter gets things done, as fast as possible. Most common use case is just one line. Even better, it's easy to migrate from traditional parsers.

This chapter aims at analyzing Jsoniter as a software project based on viewpoints and perspectives defined by Rozanski and Woods [[3](#reference-3)]. First, the Stakeholders and Context view are analysed to provide insights into the organisation of the project. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the architecture is presented in order to understand its structure. In addition, technical debt in terms of code, testing and documentation was also found throughout the analysis of the system and is presented in the chapter. Finally, the chapter concludes with our findings of the project.

## Stakeholders

Using the stakeholder analysis categories in the book Software Systems Architecture: Working with Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives we have identified several groups of stakeholders in the json-iterator [[3](#reference-3)]. In the sections below we will identify the stakeholders by category.

*Table 1: Summary most important stakeholders.*

| Stakeholders | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Acquires         | Acquires can be seen as business sponsors. The founders of json-iterator are the ones that authorize funding for the products and system development. |
| Assessors        | Assessors are stakeholders that oversee whether legal constraints are complied with. We recognize developers' ownership of the open source repository. Another legal constraint that one could think of are the licenses that the dependencies of json-iterator have. Architectured in Java and go, these two companies have an impact on it. Finally, there are the licenses that json-iterator itself uses. These licenses have an effect on the users and potentially limit certain usages of the framework. |
| Communicators    | Communicators are experts’ system that explain the system (and its architecture) to others and additionally train the support staff of the system. Due to the lack of a dedicated support staff, the training thereof is not an applicable task in this project. Therefore, the first place to go to if   you want to obtain information about the system would be the user guide. Developers still leave GitHub addresses and their mailboxes for people to contact. |
| Users            | Users are the end users of json-iterator. They use json-iterator to parse Json. Json-iterator is fast and flexible JSON parser available in Java and Go. |
| Testers          | All bugs in the software can be emailed or issued on GitHub. Bugs and problems are picked up by the contributors on GitHub. |
| Developers       | In the case of json-iterator contributors are more than just developers. Contributors are also testers and maintainers. When contributing to this project, a developer has to test his or her own contribution before it is merged into the code base. A contribution can be the implementation of a new feature, but it can also be a bug fix, an update to the documentation or a refactor. Therefore, it differs per contribution what role a contributor has. The most outstanding contributor is [@taowen](https://github.com/taowen).  Twelve people, including [@plokhotnyuk](https://github.com/plokhotnyuk), [@caoli5288](https://github.com/caoli5288), [@ashutoshcp](https://github.com/ashutoshcp), [@elifarley](https://github.com/elifarley), [@Miha-x64](https://github.com/Miha-x64), also made their own contributor. |
| Support staff    | Json-iterator has no dedicated support staff. Whenever a user runs into problems, they have several options:<br />1. Consult the user guide: Developers   provide detailed user guide for users to refer to.<br />2. Send mail to developer: The main developer   leaves his contact mailboxes in both user manuals and open source websites.<br />3. Posting for help on major websites: There are many websites for developers to communicate with, and there will be many users of this project. So if you encounter problems, you can also post on the website for help. |
| Suppliers        | We have chosen to divide the suppliers of json-iterator into two different subcategories: the first category consists of the suppliers that are used for the development of json-iterator; the second category consists of suppliers that support the end use of json-iterator in some way.<br />1. Development suppliers: Java, Go.<br />2. End use suppliers: IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ), Maven/Gradle. |
| Maintainers      | Software solutions are assessed by the Software development team in order to maintain the programming standards and architectural choices. |

### Power Grid

The power/interest grid (see Figure 1) contains the main stakeholder categories. 

**High interest&High power:** ***Developers*** are the most important to manage, ***Maintainers*** come second as they have a hand in the evolution of the product.

**Low interest&High power:** ***Acquires*** and ***Assessors*** are relatively powerful because the system is dependent on their choices, but their interest is relatively low.

**High interest&Low power:** We have to keep ***Communicators*** and ***Testers*** very well informed to be able to perform their tasks. ***Users*** also have to be kept informed but have very limited power. 

**Low interest&Low power:** Finally, ***Development suppliers*** and ***End use suppliers*** can be monitored but do not require a lot of attention, as they have both low interest and power.

*Figure 1: Power/interest grid.*

### Quality Attribute

Different stakeholders pay attention to different quality attributes. Here are some important quality attributes that stakeholders may pay attention to.

**Reliability and Performance :** These are the foundation of a good iterator, so all stakeholders will be concerned about these quality attributes.

**Modifiability:** Developers and maintainers will be very concerned about modifiability, because it determines their workload in improving the project.

**Usability and Availability:** For users, good availability and availability of this iterator is necessary, which determines whether they will continue to use it.

**Testability and Portability:** Good testability and portability to ensure the smooth progress of the tester's work.

## Context View

Now we will take look into the details of Jsoniter. This section shows the relations, platforms, dependencies and external entities that Jsoniter uses. By reading the analysis graph you can get a clear view of the interactions of Jsoniter.



### System Scope and Responsibilities



According to the creation and development of Jsoniter that has been written in its official website, we can learn that Jsoniter was initially created to make it faster and more flexible for developers to parse JSON.

> Jsoniter, which is also called json-iterator, is fast and flexible JSON parser available in JAVA and GO. Good deal of the code is ported from dsljson, and jsonparser.



It is commonly used in data transaction, focusing on parsing JSON, which is a light form of data exchanging. Traditional JSON parsers are slow, Jsoniter Java version could be 3x times faster than jackson/gson/fastjson. If one is doing a lot of log processing or number crunching, but stuck with JSON, he or she definitely needs to consider Jsoniter to save the encoding/decoding cost. What’s more, Jsoniter will not only be the fastest paser in runtime, bust also trying hard to be the fastest paser to help developers getting their job done.

> * Jsoniter is a JSON paser available in JAVA and GO.
>
> * Jsoniter is much faster than the traditional JSON paser.
> * Jsoniter develops to be used expediently.



A problem in developing is sometimes you program in one machine, but the next time you maybe program in another machine. Now the developing team try their best to make it easier to migrate.

> * Golang version is drop-in replacement for standard library(encoding/json), json.Marshal or son.Unmarshal just replace son with jsoniter.
> * Support gson compatibility mode.
> * Support Jackson compatibility mode.



Jsoniter functions focuses on parsing and improving efficiency. The responsibilities can be divided into .. aspects, as the following:

> * flexible: Jsoniter comes with three api for the different parsing job. Iterator-api is used when input is large. Bind-api is used for parsing bind value to object. And any-api is used for lazy parsing large object. Developers can mix and match, for example, bind-api+any-api. There are totally 6 combinations!
> * optional: The default decoding/encoding mode is reflection. But we can improve the performance by dynamically generated decoder/encoder class using javassist. Another option is static code generation, which is available in all platforms.
> * validation: Json can have more or less fields than the object. It is hard for the user to catch field not set condition, as the information will be lost after the binding. Jsoniter is one of the few son parsers has implemented required property tracking.
> * stream parsing: when dealing with large son input, we might want to process them in a streaming way. The developers found existing solution to be cumbersome, so Jsoniter is invented and improves it. )

## Development View

​        The development view describes the architecture of a project from the viewpoint of the developers. It is responsible for addressing different aspects of the system development process such as code structure and dependencies, build and configuration management of deliverables, system-wide design constraints, and system-wide standards to ensure technical integrity.  It aims to provide an overview of the structure of json-iterator for stakeholders like production engineers, software developers and testers. This viewpoints concerns about module organization, common processing, standardization of design and testing, instrument and code line organization. 

### Module Structure Model

​        By reading the file, we can understand that json-iterator's design pattern is the iterator pattern. Iterator pattern: provides a method to access elements of an aggregate object in sequence without exposing its internal representation.

 ![img](https://pic4.zhimg.com/80/v2-b1d1333eb6c6e02d4cc9625e86155ccb_hd.jpg) 

The iterator pattern generally includes these specific roles:

​        1) iterator: the iterator role is responsible for defining interfaces to access and traverse elements.

​        2) concrete iterator: the concrete iterator role should implement the iterator interface and record the current position in the traversal.

​        3) container: the container role is responsible for providing the interface for creating specific iterator roles.

​        4) concrete container: the specific container role implements the interface to create the specific iterator role.

The architecture of Jsoniter is 3 layered.

- Bottom of the abstraction is service provider interface. It defines things like Encoder/Decoder or ClassDescriptor.
- Core is the implementation. Stream is the encoding part, should never reference Iterator/Any. Iterator/Any is the decoding part, iterator is forward only, Any is a wrapper of iterator to provide random access.
- Top are addons. Especially the annotation support is addon. Anything annotation support can be implemented by you using SPI. There is even support to adapt Jackson annotation so that you can keep model class unchanged.

![architecture](http://jsoniter.com/images/architecture.png)

The uniqueness of jsoniter comes from innovation:

Any data type: saves the original byte array as an object. Parsing is delayed only when it is used. In addition, any is still used as a PHP array or JavaScript object, and you don't need to worry about type conversion.

Iterator abstraction: wrap the JSON input stream as an iterator like object. You can use stream parsing to locally traverse the entire JSON object graph, just as convenient as traversing the collection objects in memory. It's similar to gson's streaming API, but it's simpler.

Trie tree: the biggest drawback (and most powerful) of JSON is that its object's fields are strings. Comparing strings in data binding is time consuming. Jsoniter uses tri tree to improve performance.

Flexible code generation: all coder / encoder logic can be generated. It also provides three methods: reflection, dynamic code generation and static code generation. Various Java platforms are available.

Only pay for the function you need: when InputStream is used as input, it is slower than byte []. Traditional parsers use inheritance or function switch to do abstract implementation, but this is detrimental to performance. Jsoniter uses dynamic code generation to implement class shadowing, thus realizing lossless switching.

Verify required fields: none of the mainstream JSON parsers has the function of checking required fields. When you see that an int is 0, you don't know whether the value in JSON is 0 or whether the upstream didn't send this field. Jsoniter uses bit bits to track every required field, which is very efficient.

### Codeline Model

The overall structure of codeline is defined as how the code is controlled or designed, where different types of source code exist in that structure, and how it should be maintained and extended over time. 

The following table will show you a simpler structure of the source code to let you know more about how the project is organized, tested and managed. In the first place, the Jsoniter is divided into three big directories. 

![Jsoniter.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/31/v1cf6iOEY72tAxN.png)

| Directory    | Descriptions                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| android-demo | An example of Android project |
| demo         | An example of a Java project  |
| src          | The main part of Jsoniter.    |

 The src is the main directory about the Jsoniter, which is divided into seven directories as well. There are 7 packages, listed in abstraction level order:

#### bottom abstraction

- spi: bottom of the abstraction

#### concrete implementations

- iterator/any: these two packages are tangled together, doing decoding
- output: doing encoding, should only depend on spi

#### addons:

- annotation: make spi accessible with annotation. everything here can be done using code

- fuzzy: pre-defined decoders to work with messy input

- extra: extra encoders/decoders, useful for a lot of people, but not all of them

- static_codegen: command to generate encoder/decoder statically



### Standardization Of Design

Since Jsoniter is an open source library, everyone is free to contribute to the repository on GitHub. Seeing as multiple contributors are influencing Jsoniter, the core developers have standardized aspects of the design of the system to make it as maintainable, reliable and technically cohesive as possible. There is not a lot of information available about the general design of the platform, but the core developers have made some guidelines for new contributors to keep the overall code quality high and the licenses applicable.  

- If some external developers want to contribute code to Jsoniter, they can create it through GitHub by branching the repository and sending requests for that branch. Contributors have to use git and have a GitHub account to be able to fork the github repository.
- Use a text editor or IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to make changes individually.
- Record changes in the CHANGELOG.md. Explain what has been done in the proposed changes.
- Please read the regulations in the user manual and CHANGELOG.md before making the modification request, and the developer must agree to approve the modification before publishing.

- When submitting changes, the external developers should make every effort to follow existing coding conventions and styles in order to keep the code as readable as possible.



## Deployment View

The deployment view shows how software systems interact with the entire system, including hardware. It defines physical, computational, and software-based requirements for running the system. 

![](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/24/6P9nGYxufrI1qzW.png)

*Figure 3: deployment view*

**Runtime environment:** Jsoniter can be used in both Java and Go environments, but it should be noted that JDK 8+ is required when using it in Java environment.

**Memory required:** Aside from the memory required to install jsoniter from GitHub in the first place, no other hardware requirements for using jsoniter are mentioned anywhere. jsoniter requires around 1.33 MB of storage space to be installed. 

**Operation system:** Jsoniter can be used in any platform.

## Evolution View

Jasniter is a small tool that has only one version and has completed most of the functionality at the first release. There are only 16 releases in total, most of which are bug fixes.

## Functional View

In this section, we will discuss the most important and unique functionalities of Jsoniter.This will depart into three parts: api、code generation、lazy parsing.

### Api

Jsonitor come with three api for different parsing jobs.

> Interator-api:when input is large
>
> Bind-api:bind value to object
>
> Any-api:lazy parsing large object

And we can mix and match these api.

#### bind-api + any-api

```
public class ABC {
    public Any a; // lazy parsed
}

JsonIterator iter = JsonIterator.parse("{'a': {'b': {'c': 'd'}}}".replace('\'', '"'));
ABC abc = iter.read(ABC.class);
System.out.println(abc.a.get("b", "c"));
```

when certain field do not want to bind eagerly, we can parse them later.

#### iterator-api + bind-api

```
public class User {
    public int userId;
    public String name;
    public String[] tags;
}

JsonIterator iter = JsonIterator.parse("[123, {'name': 'taowen', 'tags': ['crazy', 'hacker']}]".replace('\'', '"'));
iter.readArray();
int userId = iter.readInt();
iter.readArray();
User user = iter.read(User.class);
user.userId = userId;
iter.readArray(); // end of array
System.out.println(user);
```

when using itrator, but do not want to bind field by field

#### any-api + bind-api

```
String input = "{'numbers': ['1', '2', ['3', '4']]}".replace('\'', '"');
String[] array = JsonIterator.deserialize(input).get("numbers", 2).to(String[].class);
```

after we extracted value from `Any`, then we can bind it to object using bind-api

#### total 6 combinations

- iterator-api => bind-api: JsonIterator.read
- iterator-api => any-api: JsonIterator.readAny
- bind-api => iterator-api: register type decoder or property decoder
- bind-api => any-api: use `Any` as data type
- any-api => bind-api: Any.as(class)
- any-api => iterator-api: JsonIterator.parse(any)

### Performance

One of strengths of Jsonitor is the outstanding performance.

User can choose different decoding/encoding mode.For example,  We can improve the performance by dynamically generated decoder/encoder class using javassist.Jsonitor has three different decoding/encoding modes, as the following:

- reflection: the default, and support private class or field
- dynamic code generation: require javassist library dependency, public class/field only
- static code generation: also an option

![Any.jpg](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/31/qu9SZYN4rVkM5nI.jpg)

*Figure 4: Implementation of code generation.*

The following is the descriptions of the three steps.

#### Dependency

When using dynamic code generation, we must add dependencies,like this:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.javassist</groupId>
    <artifactId>javassist</artifactId>
    <version>3.21.0-GA</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Define class

This is the first step,like this:

```
public class TestObject {
    private int field1;
    private int field2;
}
```

#### Set mode

This is the second step:

```
JsonIterator.setMode(DecodingMode.DYNAMIC_MODE_AND_MATCH_FIELD_WITH_HASH);
JsonStream.setMode(EncodingMode.DYNAMIC_MODE);
```

#### Call CodegenConfig setup

Final step:

```
<plugin>
<groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
<artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<version>1.5.0</version>
<executions>
    <execution>
	<id>static-codegen</id>
	<phase>compile</phase>
	<goals>
	    <goal>exec</goal>
	</goals>
	<configuration>
	    <executable>java</executable>
	    <workingDirectory>${project.build.sourceDirectory}</workingDirectory>
	    <arguments>
		<argument>-classpath</argument>
		<classpath/>
		<argument>com.jsoniter.static_codegen.StaticCodegen</argument>
		<argument>com.jsoniter.demo.DemoCodegenConfig</argument>
	    </arguments>
	</configuration>
    </execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
```

### Lazy Parsing

It is tedious to design a class to describe the schema of data. Jsoniter allow us to decode the json as an `Any` object, and start using it right away. The experience is very similar to PHP json_decode.

For a given JSON, if we use traditional way to parse it, it will be list of hash map

```
List users = (List) iter.read();
int total = 0;
for (Object userObj : users) {
    Map user = (Map) userObj;
    List friends = (List) user.get("friends");
    total += friends.size();
}
return total;
```

using `Any`, we can lazy parse it:

```
Any users = iter.readAny();
int total = 0;
for (Any user : users) { // array parsing triggered
    total += user.getValue("friends").size(); // object parsing triggered
}
return total;
```

![performance.jpg](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/31/EIivN168YRUD9cK.jpg)

*Figure 5: Implementation of Any.*

We don't need to know what type the data is.We just need to use an Any to define it.

For an Any data,when we use a method, it will judge the datatype. Different type has different method.

In fact, Any is a abstract class. It overwrites the methods, such as bindTo( )、set( )、get( ).

Any can get value directly from nested structure. Any also can read value in the type you want, regardless the actual type in the json.
